a) 

Our repository can be found under this url: https://github.com/h0p-fr0g/performance_cockpit

b)

The interface doesn't fulfill the CRUD pattern. C(reate) and R(ead) are given but there are no operations for updating and deleting.

Examples for update-methods would be:

- public void updateSalesMan(int sid)
- public void updateSalesManFirstname(int sid, String firstname)
- public void updateSocialPerformanceRecordScore(int sid, int year, int score)

We've included the following delete-methods:

- public void deleteSalesMan( int sid )
- public void deleteRecord(int sid, int year)
- public void deleteAllRecordsBySalesMan(int sid)

We didn't include bulk-delete-methods like

- public void deleteAllSalesMan()
- public void deleteAllRecords()

because these operations are too powerful and pose an unacceptable risk of data loss in a production environment.

c)

Tests are implemented in the ManagePersonalTest - Class withing the test package.
